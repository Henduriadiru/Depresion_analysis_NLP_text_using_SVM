# Depresion_analysis_NLP_text_using_SVM
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets and predict signs of depression. The model utilizes Word2Vec embeddings and a classification algorithm (SVM) to detect depressive sentiment from text. And finding the best parameters of SVM using gridsearch.

🧠 Depression Text Analysis with NLP

A machine learning project that classifies text related to depression using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The app includes data visualization (PCA and t-SNE) and sentiment prediction using a custom-trained Word2Vec + SVM pipeline.

## 🧪 Sample Dataset

The dataset should contain two columns:
- `tweet` — Raw tweet text in data repo. You can use sample data. Its cleaned data and i added tokens column
- `label` — `1` for depressed sentiment, `0` for non-depressed
